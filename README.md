#This assignment focuses on debugging a faulty C program, "noworky.c," and developing a multi-threaded light sampling application for the BeagleBone Green (BBG). The debugging task involves identifying and fixing a bug in the provided C code using gdb and a graphical debugger, and documenting the debugging process. The light sampling application requires wiring a photoresistor, joystick, and LED matrix to the BBG and creating a program that samples light levels, computes statistics, and displays the results. The program must be well-structured, modular, and thread-safe, with no busy waits, and exit smoothly upon user input. Deliverables include debugging session logs, a screenshot of the graphical debugger, and a compressed archive of the source code and makefile.
